# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
